<h1>URI Scheme QA Test</h1>
<p>This is an example page of a URI scheme firing the app to open. Please keep in mind that this URI scheme will not be routing a user to a speicific piece of content.
</br>
</br>
<b>NOTE:</b> Branch links will contain both URI Schemes and Universal Links, which will then automatically determine how to open the app. Branch Links that would be fired via a URI scheme will call back to Branch requesting the link data allowing the user to be pointed to the desired location.
