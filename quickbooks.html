To reset your entitlements long press the link above and select <b>Open in "Self Employed"</b>.

<h3>How did Universal Links get disabled</h3> 
<p>What happened was that at one point you must have clicked the app.link in the top right hand corner.
</br>
Once a user does this, Apple sets the user preference to always go to mobile web for that domain. This is an Apple issue and you can reset your entitlements by uninstalling and reinstalling or long pressing any deep link and clicking on "Open in Houzz".
