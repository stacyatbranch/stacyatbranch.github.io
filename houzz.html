<p>
  To reset your entitlements long press the link above and select <b>Open in "Houzz"</b>.
</p>
<h3>How did Universal Links get disabled</h3> 
<p>What happened was that at one point you must have clicked the bnc.lt from the app.
</br>
Once a user does this, Apple sets the user preference to always go to mobile web for that domain. This is an Apple issue and you can reset your entitlements by uninstalling and reinstalling or long pressing any deep link and clicking on "Open in Houzz". </p>

There is a very descriptive <a href="https://medium.com/mobile-growth/the-things-i-hate-and-you-should-know-about-apple-universal-links-5beb15f88a29">post on Medium</a> walking through how users disable Universal Links and how to re-enable them.
